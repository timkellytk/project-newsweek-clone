# React and Tailwind CSS Clone - Newsweek Clone

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/using-bootstrap)

This project is a clone of [Newsweek homepage](https://www.newsweek.com/) using React and Tailwind CSS. The CSS is generated using PostCSS with Autoprefixer to add vendor prefixes and PurgeCSS to remove unused CSS classes.
